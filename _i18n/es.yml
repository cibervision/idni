  content_what_is_tau_chain: Tau is a blockchain based decentralized network that can automatically be changed based on its users’ decisions. To reach effective decisions, Tau will help its users overcome the bottlenecks inherent in discussions among humans by using a paradigm of Human-Machine-Human communication. As such, Tau could understand the entire conversation and will be able to scale human collaboration and amplify the creation of knowledge for its users
  tau_feature: Tau-chain Main Features
  only_dynamic: The only dynamic decentralized social network
  content_only_dynamic: When Tau’s community will face a decision to change Tau or its blockchain protocol, they will just need to express their opinions and perspectives, like we do today in the social networks, and Tau will self-amend itself based on users’ agreement. Considering the perspectives of the entire community (unlike voting) is the only way to reach a decentralized decision that benefits all users. Tau’s ability to scale discussions is the only decentralized solution to create a true dynamic protocol.
  content_video: The video above is only an illustration of Tau’s design. User discussions can focus on everyday subjects or particular disciplines (life science, politics, computer science, etc.). Only discussions about Tau’s specifications will change its protocol upon reaching an agreement
  the_road_map: The Roadmap
  content_the_road_map: We designed a five-stage roadmap where each stage can support the development of the next one. We expect to complete the development of TML and Alpha Tau, during 2018. Using Alpha Tau’s discussion platform an infinite number of developers can join the project to support building Beta Tau expediting its go-to-market date. After Beta Tau is developed, it will only be a matter of time until Tau-Chain is completed as all technical challenges will be resolved using Beta Tau.

  content: <h3>Agoras Product Purchase Agreement</h3>
        <p>By purchasing future Agoras tokens the Purchaser expressly agrees to all of the terms and conditions set forth in the accompanying Terms and Conditions of the Agoras Private Sale (the “Terms”), which is incorporated by reference herein, as well as the Agoras Product Purchase Agreement. All capitalized terms in this agreement will be given the same effect and meaning as in the Terms.</p>
        <p>By purchasing Agoras, the Purchaser:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Represents and warrants that the Purchaser has an understanding of the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, like bitcoin (BTC), and blockchain­based software systems, and P2P networks in general.</li>
          <li>Represents and warrants that the Purchaser is legally permitted to purchase Agoras in thePurchaser’s jurisdiction.</li>
          <li>Represents and warrants that Purchaser is not exchanging bitcoin (BTC) for Agoras for the purpose of speculative investment; and</li>
          <li>Represents and warrants that the Purchaser is acquiring Agoras for the use of renting computational power or the purchase of tokens specific to forthcoming decentralized applications on the Agoras Platform, or to facilitate development, testing, deployment and operation of decentralized applications on the Agoras Platform, or to support the development of the Agoras Platform</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Purchaser understands that there is no warranty whatsoever on Agoras, express or implied, to the extent permitted by law, and that Agoras is purchased on an “as is” basis. Purchaser also understands that the Company will not provide any refund of the purchase price for Agoras under any circumstance.</p>
        <p>Purchaser further agrees to accept sole risk for the purchase of Agoras. The Purchaser recognizes thatthe Agoras Platform is presently being developed and may undergo significant changes before release.</p>
        <p>Purchaser understands, that while the Company will make reasonable efforts to complete the Agoras
          software, it is possible that an official completed version of the Agoras Platform may not be released
          and there may never be an operational Agoras Platform. It is also possible that even if the Company
          releases a completed version of the Agoras Platform, due to a lack of public interest in decentralized
          applications or the Agoras Platform itself, the Agoras Platform could potentially be abandoned or shut
          down for lack of interest. Purchaser further recognizes that Agoras may experience extreme volatility in
          pricing
        </p>
        <p>Purchaser understands that there will be a time period between the time of purchase of Agoras in the
          Private Sale and the inception of the Agoras Platform system with the creation of the Genesis Block
          and the Agoras distributions to Purchaser. Purchaser understands that there is no assurance that, if the
          Agoras platform is launched, the platform software will be stable, or that the Agoras ecosystem will be
          robust. Purchaser understands that the Agoras Platform software developed may give rise to other,alternative, Agoras­based or Agoras­like networks, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which
          Purchaser’s Agoras will have no intrinsic value.
        </p>
        <p>THE PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
