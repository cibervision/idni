  what_is_tau_chain: What is Tau-Chain
  content_what_is_tau_chain: Tau is a blockchain based decentralized network that can automatically be changed based on its users’ decisions. To reach effective decisions, Tau will help its users overcome the bottlenecks inherent in discussions among humans by using a paradigm of Human-Machine-Human communication. As such, Tau could understand the entire conversation and will be able to scale human collaboration and amplify the creation of knowledge for its users
  tau_feature: Tau-chain Main Features
  only_dynamic: The only dynamic decentralized social network
  content_only_dynamic: When Tau’s community will face a decision to change Tau or its blockchain protocol, they will just need to express their opinions and perspectives, like we do today in the social networks, and Tau will self-amend itself based on users’ agreement. Considering the perspectives of the entire community (unlike voting) is the only way to reach a decentralized decision that benefits all users. Tau’s ability to scale discussions is the only decentralized solution to create a true dynamic protocol.
  content_video: The video above is only an illustration of Tau’s design. User discussions can focus on everyday subjects or particular disciplines (life science, politics, computer science, etc.). Only discussions about Tau’s specifications will change its protocol upon reaching an agreement
  the_road_map: The Roadmap
  content_the_road_map: We designed a five-stage roadmap where each stage can support the development of the next one. We expect to complete the development of TML and Alpha Tau, during 2018. Using Alpha Tau’s discussion platform an infinite number of developers can join the project to support building Beta Tau expediting its go-to-market date. After Beta Tau is developed, it will only be a matter of time until Tau-Chain is completed as all technical challenges will be resolved using Beta Tau.
