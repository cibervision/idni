  what_is_tau_chain: 什么是Tau-Chain
  content_what_is_tau_chain: Tau是基于区块链的分散式网络，可以根据用户的决定自动进行更改。 为了做出有效的决策，Tau将通过使用人机交互的范例帮助用户克服人类讨论中固有的瓶颈。 因此，Tau可以理解整个对话，并能够扩展人与人之间的协作，并为其用户创造知识
  tau_feature: Tau-chain Main Features
  only_dynamic: The only dynamic decentralized social network
  content_only_dynamic: When Tau’s community will face a decision to change Tau or its blockchain protocol, they will just need to express their opinions and perspectives, like we do today in the social networks, and Tau will self-amend itself based on users’ agreement. Considering the perspectives of the entire community (unlike voting) is the only way to reach a decentralized decision that benefits all users. Tau’s ability to scale discussions is the only decentralized solution to create a true dynamic protocol.
  content_video: The video above is only an illustration of Tau’s design. User discussions can focus on everyday subjects or particular disciplines (life science, politics, computer science, etc.). Only discussions about Tau’s specifications will change its protocol upon reaching an agreement
  the_road_map: the Roadmap
  content_the_road_map: We designed a five-stage roadmap where each stage can support the development of the next one. We expect to complete the development of TML and Alpha Tau, during 2018. Using Alpha Tau’s discussion platform an infinite number of developers can join the project to support building Beta Tau expediting its go-to-market date. After Beta Tau is developed, it will only be a matter of time until Tau-Chain is completed as all technical challenges will be resolved using Beta Tau.

  what_is_agoras: What is Agoras
  content_what_is_agoras: Agoras is a new, smart economy, where everyone can generate income by conducting knowledge-based transactions. Leveraging Tau’s design and architecture, Agoras will connect users with relevant knowledge to solve complex problems in different disciplines. Agoras will use its own smart contract capabilities to avoid fraudulent activities, set transaction price and verify “shipping” of knowledge. As AGRS will inherit Tau's architecture, the parameters of AGRS will be dynamic and can be changed based on the community desire
