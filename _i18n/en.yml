  what_is_tau_chain: What is Tau
  content_what_is_tau_chain_italic: Tau is a decentralized blockchain network intended to solve the bottlenecks inherent in large scale human communication and accelerate productivity in human collaboration using logic based Artificial Intelligence.
  content_what_is_tau_chain_p1: Currently, large scale discussions and collaborative efforts carried out directly between people are highly inefficient. To address this problem, we developed a paradigm which we call Human-Machine-Human communication&colon; the core principle is that the users can not only interact with each other but also make their statements clear to their Tau client. Our paradigm enables Tau to deduce areas of consensus among its users in real time, allowing the network to boost communication by acting as an intermediary between humans. It does so by collecting the opinions and preferences its users wish to share and logically constructing opinions into a semantic knowledge base.
  content_what_is_tau_chain_p2: Able to deduce consensus and understand discussions, Tau can automatically generate and execute code on consensus basis, through a process known as code synthesis. This will greatly accelerate knowledge production and expedite most large scale collaborative efforts we can imagine in today's world.
  tau_feature: Tau Main Features
  only_dynamic: The Only Dynamic Decentralized Social Network
  content_only_dynamic1: This process of scaling discussions, code automation and real time social choice can be applied to the network itself, allowing the entire blockchain protocol of Tau to be defined and amended seamlessly by the choices of its users.
  content_only_dynamic2: When the Tau community intends to make changes to the network code, rules or protocols, they will simply need to express these opinions and perspectives in a compatible language over the network. The self defining logic of the Tau blockchain network will enable it to detect the consensus among these opinions and automatically amend its own code to reflect this consensus from block to block. Unlike the common method of voting, Tau’s approach will take into account the perspectives of the entire community, where people will be free to vote and propose what to vote for in real time. This unique ability of Tau is the only decentralized solution to create a truly dynamic protocol.
  content_video: The video above is a preliminary illustration of how discussions over Tau may take form. User discussions can focus on everyday subjects or particular disciplines, such as science and politics. Tau will be aware to discussions about itself and change accordingly.
  the_road_map: The Roadmap
  content_the_road_map: We designed a roadmap where each stage supports the development of the next one and is a useful technological innovation on its own. We expect to complete the development of TML and Alpha Tau in 2019. Using Alpha Tau’s discussion platform, an unbounded number of developers can join the project to support building Beta Tau, expediting its go-to-market date. After Beta Tau is developed, it will only be a matter of time until Tau-Chain is completed as all technical challenges will be resolved using Beta Tau, collaboratively, and hopefully in a development scale never seen before.
 
  feature_lang_title : The Internet of Languages
  feature_lang_content: There is no single best language for all purposes which is why we build the Tau Meta Language (TML)&colon; a language intended to define other languages and translate between them while maintaining the same information. TML allows seamless communication and semantic translation between programming languages, knowledge representation languages, visualization and organization formats, domain-specific languages, and more.

  feature_knowledge_title : Global Knowledgebase
  feature_knowledge_content: Once knowledge representation languages are defined under the TML, any user can freely submit opinions and ideas as logical predicates to their Tau client, or broadcast it to the Tau network, which combine to form a knowledge base. Users may in turn query this knowledge base and Tau will help them deduce the answers they seek. The production of knowledge heavily depends on the efficiency of discussions. Therefore, by resolving the bottleneck of large scale discussions, Tau can effectively greatly accelerate the production of all knowledge worldwide.

  feature_economy_title : Agoras Smart Knowledge Economy
  feature_economy_content: Agoras is an advanced knowledge economy that enables pure knowledge-cash transactions...

  feature_collaboration_title : Accelerating and Automating Collaboration
  feature_collaboration_content: Many worthwhile human undertakings depend on collaborative efforts. By expediting these efforts, we can effectively accelerate the development of our entire species. In addition to being able to scale discussions, Tau's decidable logical framework allows it to synthesize and execute code based on user specifications. Users can create their own teams under Tau to discuss and collaborate on a project with its own private knowledge base. After taking advantage of Tau's ability to scale discussions, teams can quickly reach a consensus on the specifications and Tau can automatically generate and execute code, according to those specifications.

  feature_discussion_title : Scaling Discussions
  feature_discussion_content: Discussions are a highly valuable social process of exchanging thoughts and opinions which can lead to inspiring fresh ideas and deducing new concepts. Currently, discussions on a large scale are highly inefficient&colon; having a discussion among 500 people generally yields a less productive result than a discussion between 5 people. But what if we could not only listen to hundreds of people at once, but comprehend and process all this information in a useful way? By having Tau as an organizer in our Human-Machine-Human approach to communication, we can effectively summarize and query all discussed data in an efficient and comprehensible way, and, for the first time in history, allow discussions to accommodate for any number of participants while remaining productive. Having a x100 increase in discussion participants under Tau could, in theory, yield x100 more information utility and knowledge productivity.

  feature_choice_title : Real Time Social Choice
  feature_choice_content: Forming a fair, comprehensive and efficient method of social choice has proven elusive in many fields. In large communities, deciding on which issues to vote on becomes unwieldy, leading to many important social topics and insights being ignored. Similarly, large organizations are often paralyzed in their inability to make important network wide choices, leading to low productivity and even failure. Tau introduces an innovative social choice mechanism&colon; users only need to express their opinions in the form of logical predicates (using language defined over TML) posted on the network, enabling Tau knowledge base to be an aggregate of social preferences of every opinion of all its users. Together with the logical property of decidability and a novel consensus formula of ours, the social choice mechanism allows Tau to calculate things like the consensus on every topic expressed, regardless of how remote or esoteric the subject matter.

  road_map_in_progress: In progress

  roadmap_title_1: MVP Launch&colon; Tau Meta Language (TML) 
  roadmap_date_1: Q3 2018
  roadmap_content_1: We start by developing a metalanguage (TML) as a tool to define new languages that can be translated among themselves. TML will be a decidable language that holds unique characteristic to interpret and redefine itself, similar (but more expressive) to Datalog, as it allows unrestricted [unstratified] negation. TML will also be able to perform all computational tasks that are computable in polynomial space. We learned from history's mistakes to insist that our implementation will be highly optimized.

  roadmap_title_2: Demo
  roadmap_date_2: Q3 2018
  roadmap_content_2: A program will be released for users to get a teaser of how communicating to Tau may look like.

  roadmap_title_3: Futamura's Projections
  roadmap_date_3: Q4 2018
  roadmap_content_3: TML’s first mission is to define itself in the method of Partial Evaluation, which gives rise to Futamura's projections. It will be the first non-Turing-complete implementation of Futamura's projections, the holy grail of compilation abilities.

  roadmap_title_4: Internet of Languages
  roadmap_date_4: Q1 2019
  roadmap_content_4: A user interface that leverages TML will be created to develop a system that can easily define, store, and translate languages. The Internet of Languages will make languages irrelevant, given the network’s ability to translate from one language to another while keeping the same exact meaning.

  roadmap_title_5: Knowledge Network
  roadmap_date_5: Q2 2019
  roadmap_content_5: To finally reach a scalable discussion platform, we will build infrastructures to store and query bulks of knowledge, represented by languages from the Internet of Languages.

  roadmap_title_6: Alpha Version Launched
  roadmap_date_6: Q3 2019
  roadmap_content_6: Alpha is a social platform that allows efficient discussions between an infinite number of participants. It will be able to scale discussions and detect logical points of consensus between users, enabling users to easily map the opinions raised during any discussions. Better knowledge sharing and construction will be made possible.


  roadmap_title_7: Beta Version Launched
  roadmap_date_7: Q4 2019
  roadmap_content_7: Beta will advance Alpha by allowing users to discuss code requirements and then automatically synthesize a correct-by-construction code.


  roadmap_title_8: Tau-Chain
  roadmap_date_8: Q1 2020
  roadmap_content_8: Tau is about perpetual collaborative development of itself based on user agreements. It will do so as a decentralized and blockchain-based p2p network.

  roadmap_title_9: Agoras
  roadmap_date_9: Q1 2020
  roadmap_content_9: A fully featured knowledge economy allowing knowledge-cash transactions, computational resources market, and advanced financial tools.
  
agoras:
  what_is_agoras: What is Agoras
  content_what_is_agoras: Agoras will be a fully featured intelligent economy revolving around the production, distribution and pricing of knowledge, thereby aligning monetary incentives with Tau’s capabilities over which it is constructed. Agoras will also share Tau’s dynamic architecture, allowing its parameters to be amended based on the community's desire in real time. In addition, it will feature a computational resource market as well as advanced financial tools such as a derivatives exchange that allows risk-free interest with zero inflation.
  main_features: Agoras Main Features
  cryptocurrency: Our Future Cryptocurrency (AGRS)
  content_cryptocurrency1 : Agoras will be the coin of natural and artificial knowledge over the new online society that we are building. Agoras will represent all tradable knowledge and computational resources on the network, while acting as the first monetary market to acquire risk-free interest without printing new money.
  content_cryptocurrency2: Agoras efficiency will allow us to have a well-priced derivatives market to allow hedging, price-stability, and risk-free interest.
  exchanges: Exchanges
  pre_sale: Pre-Sale
  pre_sale_content_1: We made a pre-sale of part of the future Agoras coins, and the rest will be pre-sold on a later stage. There is a total amount of 42,000,000 intermediate coins (IDNI Agoras Tokens) that represent 100% of future Agoras coins.
  pre_sale_content_2: IDNI Agoras (AGRS, Omni asset ID 58) is listed on <a class="text-coinmarketcap" target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/agoras-tokens/">coinmarketcap</a> featuring a partial list of exchanges.
  pre_sale_content_3: IMPORTANT&#58; BEWARE OF FAKE TOKENS! ALWAYS VALIDATE THE ASSET ID!
  pre_sale_content_4: Please read our pre-sale


  feature_knowledge_economy_title: Computational Resources Market
  feature_knowledge_economy_content: The combined computational power of all the servers of Google, Apple and Facebook is only a tiny fraction of the total processing power of the hundreds of millions of smartphones and PCs sitting idle in the hands of ordinary users. To enable users of the Tau network to tap into this unharnessed resource, a rental market for computational processing power will be built in Agoras. The design is based on the Zennet project and its innovative pricing formula...

  feature_computational_title: Advanced Financial Tools
  feature_computational_content: Agoras economy will naturally contain various types of players, such as hardware owners/renters, knowledge owners/buyers, miners and exchanges, where each player has his own hedging needs. Our economy will contain an advanced and electronic derivatives market that absents any leverage and allows risk-free interest, without the need to print new “money” (tokens).

  feature_advanced_title: Automated Businesses
  feature_advanced_content: By leveraging the power of Tau, Agoras participants will have access to a vast wealth of knowledge on every imaginable topic like the economy, law, society and information about merchants and their goods available on the market. It can then operate as user’s personal automatic businessman, intelligently tailoring complex deals in a manner that provides them a competitive edge.

  feature_vel_title: Efficiency and Fairness
  feature_vel_content: The efficiency of a market is first and foremost a function of the speed at which information propagates within that market. As our economy is entirely online, information can flow quickly and freely so we can expect Agoras to be highly efficient. This creates a fairer market in terms of information availability being more even. Another aspect of fairness is that resources on our network are typically bought by larger entities and sold by the wider audience&colon; larger players are more likely the ones who need to rent millions of computers and are willing to pay for the unique knowledge held by the user-base, while smaller participants can simply rent out their idle computing power. We can therefore expect to see money flowing in the right direction&colon; from the rich to the poor.

  feature_dictas_title: Dictas pertinax tractatos ex nam
  feature_dictas_content: Quem vocent sanctus sea ex. At quem augue virtute eos, quo odio graeci accusamus ad, sit nihil rationibus id.
  disclaimer: Disclaimer&#58; IDNI does not promote any of the exchanges listed above. Trading cryptocurrency involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for everyone.

  title: Company Update
  content: <p>The duty to develop the Tau and Agoras projects, under the development of&#58; Intelligent Decentralized Networks Initiatives LTD, a Seychelles company, has been transferred to a company incorporated in Liechtenstein; IDNI AG located at Landstrasse 36, FL-9495 Triesen Liechtenstein</p>
           <p>It's important to stress there will no change to current management and, this transfer does not materially change or diminish any of your rights, or our responsibilities. Instead, this greatly assists us in expediting the development of the products and should be seen as a boon to the project overall.</p>
           <p>Regulation in the Blockchain space has seen dramatic creation and companies creating products in the space have had to make sure they comply alongside many changing regulations on a global scale. Through our extensive research (trialling over 20 potential countries), Liechtenstein is the fundamentally the most fertile space for the company to be headquartered for these main reasons&#58;</p>
           <ul>
           <li>1)    Liechtenstein Blockchain Act – Liechtenstein is currently the only nation with dedicated Blockchain legislation, not merely ‘Crypto-friendly’ but regulated and fit for the grand scale that we envision for this project. Liechtenstein's Blockchain Act has definitive policies and provides a framework for us to work within and refer to; without ambiguity as to what is, and isn’t possible.</li>
           <li>2)    Stability – Liechtenstein is by far the most economically stable country on the list of viable locations reviewed. Being one of the rare countries on earth with a positive account surplus and no debt. We reviewed each country, alongside many legal advisors, qualitative and quantitative factors on stability, including but not limited to&#58; Bank stability, fraud, domestic policies, foreign relations, political stability, financial stability and global sentiment on its leaderships actions.</p></li>
           <li>3)    Partnerships – As Liechtenstein rapidly grows to being the dominant location for companies in the Blockchain space, this seeds more businesses that we can work with and grow alongside.</li>
           <li>4)    Blockchain Compliance – Switzerland/Liechtenstein has the most comprehensive compliance </li>
           <li>5)    Service providers – Liechtenstein has a wealth of Blockchain ready service providers and a well-knit ecosystem for companies such as ours. You will be hard pressed to find accountants that understand crypto as well we do. We have already found great benefit in this area.</li>
           <li>6)    Access to EU and Swiss markets - This greatly assists us in a multitude of ways.</li>
           </ul>
